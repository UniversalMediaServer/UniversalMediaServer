Installers for Windows and macOS, and tarballs for Linux, can be found at:

https://www.universalmediaserver.com

To install Universal Media Server (UMS) from the tarball on Linux, follow these steps:
(Replace $VERSION with your downloaded version)

Note: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04, but should work similarly on most Unix distributions.

1. **Install dependencies (run once):**

UMS bundles Java Runtime Environment (JRE), except for ARM releases.
For ARM, ensure JRE 17 is installed.

Install other prerequisites:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mediainfo dcraw vlc-bin mplayer mencoder
Optionally, install dcraw (if not already installed):

2. **Download the tarball:**

Go to https://www.universalmediaserver.com  
The website normally auto-detects your system and architecture.  
If not, manually select your version by clicking the arrow next to the download button.

Alternatively, download directly in terminal (replace $VERSION with the actual version, e.g. 13.5.0-x86_64):
wget
 https://github.com/UniversalMediaServer/UniversalMediaServer/releases/download/$VERSION/UMS-$VERSION.tgz


3. **Extract the tarball (replace $VERSION with the actual version):**
tar xzvf UMS-$VERSION.tgz


4. **Run UMS (do NOT run as root):**
cd UMS-$VERSION
./UMS.sh
- UMS accesses some files in the UMS-$VERSION/ working directory.
- Other configuration files are located in: ~/.config/UMS

For troubleshooting, you can run:

sh -x UMS.sh
