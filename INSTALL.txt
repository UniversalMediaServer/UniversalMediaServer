Installers for Windows and Mac OS X and tarballs for Linux can be found at:

    https://code.google.com/p/universal-media-server/downloads/list

To install UMS from the tarball on Linux, open a terminal and enter the
following commands (replace <version> with the version you're installing):
Note: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, but something similar
should work on most Unix distributions)

1) Install the dependencies (this only needs to be done once):

    sudo apt-get install mediainfo openjdk-7-jre
    # you can also optionally install VLC: sudo apt-get install vlc

2) Download the tarball e.g.:

    # if wget isn't installed, run: sudo apt-get install wget
    wget https://universal-media-server.googlecode.com/files/UMS-<version>.tgz

3) Extract the tarball into a ums-<version> directory:

    tar xzvf ums-<version>.tgz

4) Run (note: UMS should NOT be run as root):

    cd ums-<version>
    ./UMS.sh

UMS accesses some files in the ums-<version> directory (the working directory).
Other files will be looked for in ~/.config/UMS
