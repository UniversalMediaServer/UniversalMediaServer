Installers for Windows and macOS and tarballs for Linux can be found at:

To install UMS from the tarball on Linux, open a terminal and enter the
following commands (set VERSION to the version you're installing):
Note: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04, but something similar
should work on most Unix distributions)

1. Install the dependencies (this only needs to be done once):
    
    All releases of UMS come with Java Runtime Environment bundled, except for
    the ARM architecture releases. You will need to ensure you have JRE 17 installed.

    Next, add some other pre-reqs:

        sudo apt-get install mediainfo dcraw vlc-bin mplayer mencoder
      
  you can also optionally install dcraw: `sudo apt-get install dcraw`

2. Download the tarball e.g.:

    Get the direct link from https://www.universalmediaserver.com

    Your operating system and architecture should be automatically detected so
    that you get the correct download. If for some reason you get the wrong file,
    you can manually select a file by clicking the big arrow to the right of the
    download buttons.

3. Extract the tarball into a ums-$VERSION directory:

        tar xzvf ums-$VERSION.tgz

4. Run (note: UMS should NOT be run as root):

        cd ums-$VERSION
        ./UMS.sh

UMS accesses some files in the `ums-$VERSION/` directory (the working directory).
Other files will be looked for in `~/.config/UMS`
