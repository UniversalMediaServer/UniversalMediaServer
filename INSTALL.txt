Installers for Windows and Mac OS X and tarballs for Linux can be found at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/unimediaserver/files/Official%20Releases/

To install UMS from the tarball on Linux, open a terminal and enter the
following commands (set VERSION to the version you're installing):
Note: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, but something similar
should work on most Unix distributions)

1. Install the dependencies (this only needs to be done once):
    
    First you must have Java 8 JRE installed on the server. OpenJava will not work.

        sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jre-headless

    With Java installed, we now need to add some other pre-reqs:

        sudo apt-get install mediainfo dcraw vlc-nox mplayer mencoder
      
  you can also optionally install dcraw and VLC: `sudo apt-get install dcraw vlc`

2. Download the tarball e.g.:

    get the direct link from http://sourceforge.net/projects/unimediaserver/files/Official%20Releases/
  
    if wget isn't installed, run: `sudo apt-get install wget`
    
        wget <insert the direct link here>

3. Extract the tarball into a ums-$VERSION directory:

        tar xzvf ums-$VERSION.tgz

4. Run (note: UMS should NOT be run as root):

        cd ums-$VERSION
        ./UMS.sh

UMS accesses some files in the `ums-$VERSION/` directory (the working directory).
Other files will be looked for in `~/.config/UMS`
