To install UMS from the tarball on Linux, open a terminal and follow these steps (set VERSION to the version you're installing):

Note: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04, but should work similarly on most Unix distributions.

Install dependencies (needed only once):

UMS releases come bundled with Java Runtime Environment (JRE), except for ARM architecture releases.
If you're using an ARM release, please ensure JRE 17 is installed.

Install other prerequisites:

bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mediainfo dcraw vlc-bin mplayer mencoder
Optionally, install dcraw (if not already installed):

bash
sudo apt-get install dcraw
Download the tarball:

Visit https://www.universalmediaserver.com
Your operating system and architecture are usually detected automatically.
If not, manually select your version by clicking the arrow next to the download button.

Extract the tarball:
Replace $VERSION with the downloaded version number:

bash
tar xzvf ums-$VERSION.tgz
Run UMS (do NOT run as root):

bash
cd ums-$VERSION
./UMS.sh
UMS accesses some files within the ums-$VERSION/ working directory.
Other configuration files may be found at: ~/.config/UMS
