Installers for Windows and Mac OS X and tarballs for Linux can be found at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/unimediaserver/files/Official%20Releases/

To install UMS from the tarball on Linux, open a terminal and enter the 
following commands (replace <version> with the version you're installing):
Note: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, but something similar should work on most Unix distributions)

1) Install the dependencies (this only needs to be done once):

    # UMS requires a Java Virtual Machine to run. Which version depends on which binary package was downloaded. UMS for Java 7
    would need version 7 or newer, UMS for Java 8 would need version 8 or newer. The most common JVM's to use on Linux is
    openjdk. Which, if any, of the packages that's available depends on your distro, it's version and what sources are enabled.

    # Install JVM on Debian/Ubuntu and derivates:
      Debian 8 need to use backports to install openjdk-8 at the time of writing. It's not possible to cover all the sources
      needed for the different versions in this document. If the package isn't found, make sure to run ```apt-get update``` to
      make sure the sources are refreshed.
      # To install openjdk-7 run:
      sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre
      # To install openjdk-8 run:
      sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre

    # Install JVM on Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mandriva, Red Hat/Centos and derivates: The epel repository might be needed on some
    platforms. 
      # To install openjdk-7 run:
      sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk
      # To install openjdk-8 run:
      sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

    # Install JVM on Arch:
      # To install openjdk-7 run:
      sudo pacman -S jre7-openjdk
      # To install openjdk-8 run:
      sudo pacman -S jre8-openjdk

    # UMS use MediaInfo to get information about media files. It can be run without it, but media handling will suffer as UMS
    won't have a detailed information available.
    # Install MediaInfo on Debian/Ubuntu and derivates:
    sudo apt-get install mediainfo
    # Install MediaInfo on Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mandriva, Red Hat/Centos and derivates:
    sudo yum install mediainfo 
    # Install MediaInfo on Arch (community repository must be enabled):
    sudo pacman -S mediainfo

    # You can optionally install dcraw (to decode raw images from digital cameras) and VLC (to use VLC as a transcoding engine). Just omit one if you don't want that.
    # Install dcraw and VLC on Debian/Ubuntu and derivates:
    sudo apt-get install dcraw vlc
    # Install dcraw and VLC on Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mandriva, Red Hat/Centos and derivates:
    sudo yum install dcraw vlc
    # Install dcraw and VLC on Arch (extra repository must be enabled):
    sudo pacman -S dcraw vlc

    # UMS uses tsMuxeR as a transcoding engine. tsMuxeR is 32 bit only, so installation of some 32 bit libraries are necessary
    on 64 bit platforms if you want to use tsMuxeR as a transcoding engine.
    # Install tsMuxeR dependencies on 64 bit Debian/Ubuntu and derivates:
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 libbz2-1.0:i386 libstdc++6:i386
    # Install tsMuxeR dependencies on 64 bit Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mandriva, Red Hat/Centos and derivates:
    sudo yum install zlib.i686 ncurses-libs.i686 bzip2-libs.i686 libstdc++.i686
    # Install tsMuxeR dependencies on 64 bit Arch (multilib repo must be enabled):
    sudo pacman -S lib32-zlib lib32-ncurses lib32-bzip2 lib32-libstdc++5
    
    # You can optionally install P7Zip, UMS will use it for archives browsing.
    # Install P7Zip on Debian/Ubuntu and derivates:
    sudo apt-get install p7zip
    # Install P7Zip on Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mandriva, Red Hat and derivates:
    sudo yum install p7zip
    # or on Fedora 22
    sudo dnf install p7zip
    # Install P7Zip on Arch:
    sudo pacman -S p7zip
    # Install P7Zip on RHEL/CentOS:
    sudo yum install p7zip

    # Other distros and/or package managers not covered here will need to have the same/corresponding packages installed.
    If a package isn't available, the binary must be downloaded and installed or built from source. 

2) Download the tarball e.g.:

    # if wget isn't installed, run: sudo apt-get install wget
    wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/unimediaserver/files/Official%20Releases/Linux/UMS-<version>.tgz/download

3) Extract the tarball into a ums-<version> directory:

    tar xzvf ums-<version>.tgz

4) Run (note: UMS should NOT be run as root):

    cd ums-<version>
    ./UMS.sh

5) The user may have to manually copy these files to his profile folder:

    UMS.conf
    WEB.conf
    ffmpeg.webfilters
    VirtualFolders.conf

UMS accesses some files in the ums-<version> directory (the working directory).
Other files will be looked for in ~/.config/UMS
