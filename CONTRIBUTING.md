# Reporting an issue

Often in order to help diagnose and fix your issue we need your "debug information". We have made it very easy to save and attach it to the forum:

1.  Start UMS
2.  Go to the Logs tab
3.  Choose "Trace" from the "Log Level" dropdown at the bottom
4.  Reproduce the bug
5.  Click "Pack debug files" on the lower left
6.  Click "Zip selected files"
7.  Save the zip file to a location you will remember
8.  Attach the zip file as described [below](#Attachments), with a link to the file in your issue description

If it is a new bug that wasn't there in a previous version, we will often request debug info from the last version that did not have the bug, too.
So if that is the case, please repeat the above steps for the last version without the bug.

Thanks for your efforts in helping us make UMS better!

# Creating a Pull Request

We welcome Pull Requests. Please be descriptive about the purpose of the code change, and please try to use the code conventions we use.

We will only merge Pull Requests if they don't break our automated tests, if they pass code review by one of our developers, and if they pass manual testing.

For more information, please see [our Style Guide](https://github.com/UniversalMediaServer/UniversalMediaServer/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md)

Remember to include a link to the attachment in your post here.

If you prefer to upload your attachment elsewhere, please avoid sites with restricted access or captcha if possible.
