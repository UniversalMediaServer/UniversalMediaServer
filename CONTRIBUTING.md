# Reporting an issue

Often in order to help diagnose and fix your issue we need your "debug information". We have made it very easy to save and attach it to the forum:

1.  Start UMS
2.  Go to the Logs tab
3.  Choose "Trace" from the "Log Level" dropdown at the bottom
4.  Reproduce the bug
5.  Click "Pack debug files" on the lower left
6.  Click "Zip selected files"
7.  Save the zip file to a location you will remember
8.  Attach the zip file as described [below](#Attachments), with a link to the file in your issue description

If it is a new bug that wasn't there in a previous version, we will often request debug info from the last version that did not have the bug, too.  
So if that is the case, please repeat the above steps for the last version without the bug.

Thanks for your efforts in helping us make UMS better!
