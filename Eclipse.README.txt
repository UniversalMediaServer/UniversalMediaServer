You can find some helpful files in the root folder of the repository if you're
using Eclipse as your IDE. To import UMS into Eclipse as a project, go to:
File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Project
and browse to the root of the UMS git repository. Naming the project "UniversalMediaServer" will
make the included debug configuration work without further configuration.

- UMS.launch:
    This is a pre-configured debug configuration for Eclipse that will only
    work without editing if your Eclipse project is called "UniversalMediaServer". To run UMS
    in Eclipse, simply select the file and either press F11 or choose debug from
    the main menu or the context menu.

The other files are "code style" helper files. None of these are absolute,
UMS' code certainly doesn't adhere absolutely to them. They must be seen as
helpful guides only.

Here's a description of how to configure them in Eclipse:

- Eclipse.Cleanup.xml:
    You can import import this file as a "Clean Up profile" to make
    "Eclipse Clean Up" work more in line with UMS' code style. Give it a name,
    e.g "UMS" and it can be assigned either globally or per project.

    It can be assigned either globally under:
    Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Clean Up

    or per project under:
    Project -> Properties -> Java Code Style -> Clean Up

- Eclipse.CodeTemplates.xml:
    You can import import this file as a "Code Templates profile" to make
    Eclipse's code templates work more in line with UMS' code style. Give
    it a name, e.g "UMS" and it can be assigned either globally or per project.

    It can be assigned either globally under:
    Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Code Templates

    or per project under:
    Project -> Properties -> Java Code Style -> Code Templates

- Eclipse.Formatter.xml:
    You can import import this file as a "Formatter profile" to make
    Eclipse's formatter work more in line with UMS' code style. Give
    it a name, e.g "UMS" and it can be assigned either globally or per project.

    It can be assigned either globally under:
    Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter

    or per project under:
    Project -> Properties -> Java Code Style -> Formatter

- CheckStyle.xml:
    You can use this file with CheckStyle independent from Eclipse. If you
    use the Eclipse CheckStyle plugin, you can create a new
    "CheckStyle profile" called for example "UMS" and then assign it either
    globally or per project. You define CheckStyle profiles under the global
    CheckStyle configuration:
    Window -> Preferences -> CheckStyle

    When creating a new profile, you can choose either
    "External Configuration File" or "Project Relative Configuration" and
    point to this file.

    The profile can then either be set as the global default or assigned to a
    project under:
    Project -> Properties -> CheckStyle
