1
00:00:02,107 --> 00:00:05,810
Alcide, you sure know
how to treat a lady.

2
00:00:05,844 --> 00:00:08,446
Alcide's employee is the
only person who can identify

3
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:10,534
<i>whoever it was</i>
<i>that freed Russell.</i>

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,417
It's a woman.

5
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:14,386
<i>A female member</i>
<i>of the Authority released Russell.</i>

6
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:15,955
Jesus, if you're out there,

7
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:18,525
<i>can you give me a sign?</i>

8
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:21,962
Lafayette!

9
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:24,797
It's called <i>ifrit.</i>
It means "the evil."

10
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,968
Eller, man, there's
no fire monster coming for us.

11
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:31,438
<i>We killed those people</i>
<i>I saw it, Sergeant.</i>

12
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:34,675
The ifrit.
Now we gotta pay.

13
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:35,942
It's coming for us.

14
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:40,346
The vampires will drain anyone
with even a drop of fairy blood

15
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,382
if they don't stay together.
We gotta get Sookie.

16
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,084
She might be better off
with the vampires.

17
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:46,253
No, no, no, no. One day they're
gonna turn on her.

18
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:47,855
I know it.
They will kill her

19
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:49,557
just like they did
your parents.

20
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,125
No, my parents
were killed in a flood.

21
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,626
Weren't they?

22
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:55,696
- Make yourself useful.
- So, basically, I'm your slave.

23
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:59,433
- Pretty much.
- My blood's not good enough for you?

24
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:01,569
Please!

25
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,238
Get off of him.

26
00:01:04,574 --> 00:01:06,909
Shot down those poor people
in cold blood.

27
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:08,254
Is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

28
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:09,878
We're shifters.

29
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,713
Hey, shifter! Whoo!

30
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:13,815
We got him!

31
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,419
Emma, run!

32
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:19,822
- Wolves have been here.
- They come with Russell.

33
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:22,091
Took you long enough...

34
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,160
Hello, old friend. We've come
to finish what we started

35
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:27,329
Give it your best shot.

36
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:39,574
<i>Alcide!</i>

37
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:41,242
- Alcide!
<i>- Sookie!</i>

38
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,610
<i>Alcide!</i>

39
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,283
<i>Bill!</i>

40
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:52,352
Hmm.

41
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:55,022
Mmm.

42
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,389
You're just what
the doctor ordered,

43
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:01,860
my twee fairy vixen.

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,901
Yes, there is
that aspect of you
