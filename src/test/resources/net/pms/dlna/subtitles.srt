00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,120
Hiring a transcriber saves time and resources.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,340
Professional transcribers will ensure 

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,600
that your audio file is translated into text 

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,660
accurately 

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,880
and efficiently.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,600
Transcribers are trained and tested in certain niches

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,600
from legal and medical

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,920
to academic.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,160
Here's how it works.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,700
First, an audio file is received.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,000
Next, the file is pre-screened

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,520
to be matched with the perfect transcriber

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,960
who is then assigned the task of creating the transcript.

14
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,180
Once the transcript is created,

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,800
the document goes through rigorous quality-control channels

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,200
before being submitted to the client.

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,420
