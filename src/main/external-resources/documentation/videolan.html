	<h1>VLC media player</h1>

	<p>
		VLC (Videolan Codec) is a good choice for playing web streaming
		content. VLC is available for almost every platform including Windows,
		Linux and MacOsX. <a title="vlc 0.9.8a"
			href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/0.9.8a/">VLC
			version 0.9.8a</a> works well, later versions may have <a
			title="VLC / UMS problems"
			href="http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=63050">issues</a>.
	</p>

	<p>After installing VLC you have to restart UMS and enable the VLC
		engine. In UMS go to menu "transcoding settings". Select "VLC"
		in the menu on the left side and press the
		plug-button to enable the engine. After that do the same with
		"videolan audio streaming". You can use the blue arrow-buttons to
		change the priority of engines. If you prefer VLC as default streaming
		engine, move VLC to the top position. Press the save button and
		restart UMS.</p>

	<h2>Windows7</h2>

	<p>
		Use <a
			href="http://www.codecguide.com/windows7_preferred_filter_tweaker.htm">preferred
			filter tweaker for Windows 7 and Windows 8</a> to change from preferred Microsoft
		DTV/DVD Decoder to another
	</p>


	<h2>VLC and streaming web videos</h2>

	<p>
		Using VLC for streaming web videos like YouTube does not work well. It
		is better to use <a title="pmsencoder"
			href="http://github.com/chocolateboy/pmsencoder">pmsencoder</a>, a
		UMS <a href="plugins.html">plugin</a> which works as a wrapper for the
		external applications MEncoder and ffmpeg. Read the UMSEncoder README for
		instructions.
