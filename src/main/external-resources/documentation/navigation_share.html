	<h1>Navigation / Share Settings</h1>

	<p>The "Navigation / share settings" tab of UMS allow you to
		determine the details of how UMS shares the content to your device.

	<dl>
		<dt>Generate thumbnails</dt>
		<dd>Select the checkbox for automatic creation of thumbnail pictures of your
			media files</dd>

		<dd>Most video files begin with some seconds of a black
			background before the movie starts. You can set the time in seconds
			for the video thumbnail position.</dd>

		<dt>Use MPlayer for video thumbnails</dt>
		<dd>The external program MPlayer sometimes yields better results for thumbnail
			creation than the default thumbnailer, so just try it.</dd>

		<dt>DVD ISO thumbnails</dt>
		<dd>Create thumbnails for DVD ISO-images</dd>

		<dt>Audio thumbnails display</dt>
		<dd>You can choose the behavior for audio thumbnails; search for alphabetical thumbnail
			pictures on the filesystem, or let UMS download
			album art from coverartarchive.org</dd>

		<dt>Alternate video cover art folder</dt>
		<dd>Select the folder on your filesystem which contains cover art for videos</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>Navigation / Parsing settings</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Browse compressed archives (.rar/.zip/.cbr)</dt>

			media file in archive is chosen for playback it will be decompressed
			before streaming starts</dd>

		<dt>Hide # Video Settings # Folder</dt>
		<dd>There is a virtual folder available called "# video settings
			#". You can navigate to this folder on your device and change some
			values for UMS online. With this option you can choose to not display
			this virtual folder.</dd>

		<dt>Hide # Transcode # Folder</dt>
		<dd>You can choose to not show this virtual folder on your device.</dd>

		<dt>Hide file extensions</dt>

			like jpg or avi, so you can hide them</dd>

		<dt>Hide transcoding engine names</dt>
		<dd>UMS can stream your media file with different technologies.
			You can chose the technology (transcoding engine) in virtual folder #
			transcoded #. The default transcoding engine for playback is
