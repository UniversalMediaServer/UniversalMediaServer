	<h1>Navigation / Share Settings</h1>

	<p>The "Navigation / share settings" tab of UMS allow you to
		determine the details of how UMS shares the content to your device.
		Below are the options that are available on this tab.</p>

	<h2>Thumbnails</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Generate thumbnails</dt>
		<dd>Select the checkbox for automatic creation of thumbnail pictures of your
			media files</dd>

		<dt>Thumbnail seeking position (in seconds)</dt>
		<dd>Most video files begin with some seconds of a black
			background before the movie starts. You can set the time in seconds
			for the video thumbnail position.</dd>

		<dt>Use MPlayer for video thumbnails</dt>
		<dd>The external program MPlayer sometimes yields better results for thumbnail
			creation than the default thumbnailer, so just try it.</dd>

		<dt>DVD ISO thumbnails</dt>
		<dd>Create thumbnails for DVD ISO-images</dd>

		<dt>Audio thumbnails display</dt>
		<dd>You can choose the behavior for audio thumbnails; search for alphabetical thumbnail
			pictures on the filesystem, or let UMS download
			album art from coverartarchive.org</dd>

		<dt>Alternate video cover art folder</dt>
		<dd>Select the folder on your filesystem which contains cover art for videos</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h2>Navigation / Parsing settings</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Browse compressed archives (.rar/.zip/.cbr)</dt>
		<dd>If activated UMS is able to show the content of archives. If a
			media file in archive is chosen for playback it will be decompressed
			before streaming starts</dd>

		<dt>Hide # Video Settings # Folder</dt>
		<dd>There is a virtual folder available called "# video settings
			#". You can navigate to this folder on your device and change some
			values for UMS online. With this option you can choose to not display
			this virtual folder.</dd>

		<dt>Hide # Transcode # Folder</dt>
		<dd>You can choose to not show this virtual folder on your device.</dd>

		<dt>Hide file extensions</dt>
		<dd>Some people might get confused if they see file extensions
			like jpg or avi, so you can hide them</dd>

		<dt>Hide transcoding engine names</dt>
		<dd>UMS can stream your media file with different technologies.
			You can chose the technology (transcoding engine) in virtual folder #
			transcoded #. The default transcoding engine for playback is
			displayed after the name of each media file. With this checkbox you can hide that.</dd>

		<dt>Show Aperture library</dt>
		<dd>Only available on Mac when aperture is installed. Displays each Aperture library as a folder on your device so you can browse it.</dd>

		<dt>Enable the cache</dt>
		<dd>When you browse folders on your PS3, UMS scans each folder in
			real time and displays the results on your PS3. Additionaly there is
			a builtin cache which can be activated. If you scan your
			hard drive for media files, additional info for each file will be
			collected e.g. MP3 tags (title, album name, etc.) for MP3 audio files.
			You can browse the cache in a virtual folder on your PS3
			after scanning.</dd>

		<dt>Reset cache</dt>
		<dd>If the cache is corrupt you can use this feature to
			reset the contents of the database.</dd>

		<dd>Select how file lists are sorted and displayed on your device: by name or by date.</dd>
</dl>
		<h2>Shared folders</h2>

			secure environment you might want to chose the folders which are
			presented to your PS3. Press green + icon to add folders for access
			by UMS/PS3. Select folder and press red X icon to remove access to a
