	<h1>CoreAVC</h1>

	<p>
		<a title="CoreAVC" href="http://www.coreavc.com/">CoreAVC</a> is a
		very fast decoder for h.264 HD-videos, however it is not for free. You
		can get a trial version which is valid 14 days to see if the
		transcoding of h.264 HD-videos benefits from performance tuning.
	</p>

	<p>First of all you have to disable decoding for h.264 in ffdshow.
		If you have installed k-lite codec pack, go to Windows start menu
		"programs &gt; K-Lite Codec Pack &gt; Configuration &gt; ffdshow video
		decoder". Select menu "Codecs" on the left side and change format
		H.264/AVC from "libavcodec" to "disabled" and press OK.</p>

	<p>Now you can install CoreAVC:</p>

	</p>

	<p>

	</p>

	<p>Haali Media Splitter is already included in codec packs and
		therefore doesn't have to be installed once again.</p>
	<p>
		You should enable <a title="CUDA"
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a> if possible. Go to
		the Windows start menu "programs &gt; CoreCodec &gt; CoreAVC &gt;
		Configure CoreAVC". Check "Prefer CUDA Acceleration" and press OK.
		Please consider that CUDA is only available for NVidia based graphics
		cards. You also have to install an <a title="nvidia driver"
			href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us">up to
			date driver</a> (at least version 181.64!).
	</p>

	<p>There is no GPU-support planned in ffdshow. So CoreAVC is the
		best choice for transcoding performance at the moment.</p>
