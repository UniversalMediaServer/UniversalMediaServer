	<h1>General Configuration</h1>

	<p>The "General Configuration" tab of UMS allows you to set general
		options that determine how UMS will run. Below is an overview of the
		options on this tab.</p>


	<h2>General settings</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>Language</dt>
		<dd>Select the language of UMS. To see the selection in effect
			you have to restart UMS.</dd>

		<dt>Start minimized</dt>
		<dd>Apply if you want UMS start in the system tray (window
			minimized)</dd>

		<dt>Install as a windows service</dt>
		<dd>Click if you want to install UMS as a service. Further
			configuration may be needed to run successfully as a service.</dd>
	</dl>


	<h2>Network settings (advanced)</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>Force networking on interface</dt>
		<dd>UMS determines the default network to send broadcasts. When
			UMS does not detect your PS3 and your computer has multiple networks,
			it may have chosen the wrong default network. Select the correct
			network from the pulldown.</dd>

		<dt>Force IP of the server</dt>
		<dd>By default UMS will use the default IP address of the
			computer it runs on. If your computer has multiple IP addresses, you
			enter the preferred IP address for UMS to use here.</dd>

		<dt>Force port of server</dt>
		<dd>By default UMS uses TCP/IP port 5001. If this port is already
			in use, set a free alernate port number like 6001</dd>

		<dt>Use IP-filter</dt>
		<dd>Set IP-address of allowed streaming client (PS3), all other
			will fail to connect (not working when HTTP Engine v2 is enabled!)</dd>
	</dl>


	<h2>Advanced HTTP and system settings</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>HTTP Engine V2</dt>
		<dd>New engine to improve network performance and provide better
			support for alternate streaming clients. The code is still considered
			to be unstable, so use with caution.</dd>

		<dt>Prevent OS from sleeping when streaming</dt>
		<dd>Checking this checkbox will make sure that the computer will
			not go to standby mode while streaming.</dd>

		<dt>Default renderer when automatic detection fails</dt>
		<dd>UMS can recognize many renderers automatically. Sometimes a renderer will
			connect the UMS does not recognize. This option defines which renderer UMS
			should assume.</dd>

		<dt>Force default renderer (disable automatic detection)</dt>
		<dd>By default UMS tries to automatically detect what renderers try to connect
			to it. By settings this option to true, UMS will assume any renderer that
			connects is the default renderer.</dd>
