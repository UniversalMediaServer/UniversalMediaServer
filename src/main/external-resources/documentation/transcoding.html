	<h1>Transcoding settings</h1>

	<p>The "Transcoding settings" tab allows you to specify how content
		will be transcoded. UMS uses external programs to transcode and stream
		content to your device. Some of these programs overlap in what kind of
		media they can transcode. On this tab you can specify which order of
		preference the programs have when UMS determines how to transcode
		media. For each media type there is a list of programs, sorted by
		preference. The topmost program is most likely to be used. If it
		cannot transcode the media, the next program on the list is used, and
		so on.</p>

	<p>This tab also allows to set the details of transcoding for each
		program. Below is a list of the settings on this tab.</p>

	<h2>Common transcode settings</h2>

	<h3>General settings</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>Transcode buffer maximum size</dt>
		<dd>This value is about how much temporary space should be used
			for buffering a video before sending it to PS3. Default value is 400.</dd>

		<dt>Number of cores used for transcoding</dt>
		<dd>This value is bout how many CPU cores should be used for
			transcoding. The maximum value depends on the physical available
			count of "real processor cores". That means hyperthreading virtual
			CPU cores do not count! If you are not sure, analyze your CPU with
			the free tool CPU-z on Windows systems. On Linux have a look at the virtual
			proc-filesystem. In the file /proc/cpuinfo you will find more details
			about your CPU. You also get much information about CPUs from AMD and
			Intel from their Wikipedia-articles. Regardless, UMS should be able to
			detect and set the correct amount of cores.</dd>

		<dt>Chapters # Transcode # folder support / interval in minutes</dt>
		<dd>enable automatically creation of chapters every x minutes in
			virtual folder</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h3>Audio settings</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>Number of audio channels</dt>
		<dd>If you have a surround AV-receiver or amplifier connected to
			your PS3 select 5.1, otherwise 2 channels stereo.</dd>

		<dt>AC-3 Audio bitrate (in Kbits/s)</dt>
		<dd>Here you set the quality of digital audio sound. Your
			AV-receiver or amplifier has to be capable of playing this quality.
			Default value is 384.</dd>

		<dt>Keep DTS audio in stream</dt>
		<dd>This enables playback of DTS digital surround sound via
			optical digital audio output (toslink) of your PS3. Keep in mind that
			this increases network traffic. Your AV-receiver or amplifier needs
			an integrated DTS-decoder for playback.</dd>

		<dt>DTS/FLAC - LPCM-remux</dt>
		<dd>This enables playback of DTS digital surround sound via HDMI
			output of your PS3. Keep in mind that this increases network traffic.
			Your HDMI connected device (TV or AV-receiver or amplifier) needs an
			integrated DTS-decoder for playback.</dd>

		<dt>Remux when audio track is AC-3</dt>
		<dd>Transcoding of audio will be avoided when it is AC-3 (Dolby
			Digital). The AC-3 digital audio track will muxed into a PS3 compatible
			container if necessary. This should be activated if your PS3 is
			connected to a TV or AV-receiver or amplifier which has an integrated
			Dolby Digital Decoder. This feature is not supported when using
			AviSynth based transcoding engines.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h3>Video quality settings</h3>
		<dl>
		<dt>Maximum bandwidth in Mbits/s</dt>
		<dd>This is some kind of network throttle. One may think it is a
			brilliant idea to reduce network bandwidth in order to get HD videos
			streaming via WLAN. Experience shows that it does not work as
			expected. You need lots of CPU power for transcoding. If that is not
			a problem you will get really poor video quality when stream HD
			videos on low network bandwidth. So better leave the default value 0.
			You should also note that this setting won't affect muxed videos. You
			may have to enforce transcoding by choosing another transcoding
			engine.</dd>

		<dt>Mpeg2 Video quality settings (dropdown)</dt>
		<dd>If UMS is not able to stream directly or mux the audio/video
			to a PS3 compatible container it will transcode to MPEG2, which is PS3
			compatible. This costs lots of CPU power. This also will increase the
			network traffic because MPEG2 compression is not very good for HD
			videos. You will need a 100MBit/s LAN or DLAN for playback of
			transcoded HD videos - WLAN won't work (maybe some 720p videos will
			do). You are able to control the quality settings of MPEG2 encoding
			which corresponds to needed network bandwidth. So there are some
			parameters available to control MPEG2 quality. Keyint means keyframes,
			keyint=3 means that every third frame is a keyframe which is a
			complete picture. In between there are two pictures which only
			contain differences to the predecessing picture. A high value for
			keyint will result in a lower network bandwidth but will also cause
			bad quality in fast action scenes in movies. There are also so called
			quantizer values (vqmqx, vqmin, vqscale). High values result in low
			quality. Try out some of the values available in the dropdown.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h3>Misc options</h3>
		<dl>
		<dt>Definitely disable subtitles</dt>
		<dd>Displaying subtitles will automatically enforce transcoding.
			If you want to avoid transcoding and definitely do not need subtitles
			enable this feature.</dd>

		<dt>Skip transcode for following extensions</dt>
		<dd>Enforce direct playback for certain filetypes.</dd>

		<dt>Force transcode for following extensions</dt>
		<dd>Enforce transcoding for certain file types.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Video Files Engines: MEncoder</h2>

	<h3>Video/Audio decoder settings for MEncoder engine only</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>Use multiple CPU cores</dt>
		<dd>Enable usage of special multicore version of MEncoder tool.
			This will improve performance on multicore systems.</dd>

		<dt>Skip loop filter deblocking for h.264</dt>
		<dd>Disable deblocking filter for h.264 HD videos.</dd>

		<dt>A/V sync alternative method</dt>
		<dd>If video and audio get out of sync disabling this might help.</dd>

		<dt>Use video scaler / Width / Height</dt>
		<dd>Usually the TV or PS3 is used to upscale the video to optimal
			video resolution. MEncoder is also able to do that for you which will
			cost additional CPU power.</dd>

		<dt>Force framerate parsed from FFmpeg</dt>
		<dd>If framerate isn't recognized correctly (video is running too
			fast/slow) change this setting.</dd>

		<dt>Deinterlace-filter</dt>
		<dd>Enable deinterlace filter which will usually is done by your
			PS3 or TV.</dd>

		<dt>Remux videos with tsMuxeR when possible instead of transcoding</dt>
		<dd>When MEncoder transcoding engine is used and UMS
			recognizes a compatible video it will stream to tsMuxeR,
			which means there is no quality loss. Matroska video (mkv)
			for example aren't supported on	PS3 but often the audio
			and video streams are compatible, so tsMuxeR creates a 
			compatible m2ts container which contains the original
			audio and video stream and the PS3 is able to playback.</dd>

		<dt>Codec-specific parameters (Advanced)</dt>
		<dd>Press the button to change MEncoder parameters for certain codecs</dd>

		<dt>Custom options</dt>
		<dd>Add specific commandline options for the external program MEncoder</dd>

		<dt>Audio language prority</dt>
		<dd>Fill in the abbreviation of your native language so that UMS
			will automatically select the right audio track.</dd>

		</dl>
		
		<h3>Subtitles settings</h3>
		<dl>
		<dt>Subtitles language priority</dt>
		<dd>Fill in the abbreviation of your native language so that UMS
			will automatically select the right subtitle.</dd>

		<dt>Audio/subtitles language priority</dt>
		<dd>Language selection specific for DVD playback.</dd>

		<dt>Subtitles codepage</dt>
		<dd>The codepage should match the codepage setting on your PS3.
			cp1252 should be default.</dd>

		<dt>FriBiDi mode</dt>
		<dd>Enable FriBiDi GNU implementation of Unicode algorhithm</dd>

		<dt>Specify TrueType Font (for Asian languages)</dt>
		<dd>Select a specific font for Asian languages</dd>

		<dt>Alternate Subtitles Folder</dt>
		<dd>Select the folder on the filesystem that contains alternate subtitles</dd>

		<dt>Autoload *.srt/*.sub subtitles with the same file name</dt>
		<dd>Support for SRT subtitle format</dd>
		
		<dt>DVD/VOBsub subtitle quality</dt>
		<dd>Quality of the subtitles, from 0 to 4. Higher means better quality. Default value is 3.</dd>

	<h2>FFmpeg DVR-MS remux</h2>

	<dl>
		<dt>Alternative FFmpeg path</dt>
		<dd>This feature is for users of Microsoft Windows Mediacenter
			Edition. If you have recorded some TV shows and want to watch the
			DVR-MS files with UMS/PS3 you need a special version of FFmpeg.
			Download and unzip this file in your UMS installation directory and
			restart UMS.</dd>
