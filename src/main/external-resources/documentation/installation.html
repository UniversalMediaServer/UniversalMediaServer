	<h1>Installation and basic configuration</h1>

	<!--

		 Thanks, Otmanix!

	<h2>Java</h2>
	<p>
		Java programming language is a requirement for UMS. Therefore you need
		to install Java second edition runtime environment (JRE), at least
		version 6. You can <a href="http://java.com/en/download/">get the
			latest JRE here</a>.
	</p>


	<h2>Installation and start of UMS on Windows</h2>

	<p>
		After installing Java Runtime you can install Universal Media Server.
		Double-click the setup file and follow the instructions.
	</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/setupwin1.jpg" />
	</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/setupwin2.jpg" />
	</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/setupwin3.jpg" />
	</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/setupwin4.jpg" />
	</p>


	<h2>Installation and start of UMS on Linux</h2>

	<p>You also need to have Java installed on Linux. You should set
		environment variable JAVA_HOME to JRE installation path. After that
		you have to decompress the setup archive for Linux with:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<pre>tar xzf filename.tgz</pre>
	</blockquote>

	<p>You have to install MPlayer, MEncoder, FFmpeg and tsMuxeR. If
		you like to stream web content also install VLC. Make sure that all
		binaries of these tools can be found via PATH variable. Start a shell,
		cd to your installation directory and start UMS with:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<pre>./UMS.sh</pre>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Check permissions and set them if necessary with:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<pre>chmod ug+x UMS.sh</pre>
	</blockquote>

	<p>You can either use packages from your Linux distrubution or
		compile the tools by yourself. Sometimes distributors do not set
		important compiler options, e.g. scaling support for FFmpeg. So I
		recommend you to compile it from source.</p>


	<h2>Starting UMS</h2>

	<p>First start up and login to your PS3 or other viewing device.
		This will allow UMS to detect it on the network.</p>

	<p>After your device has started up, start UMS. UMS tries to detect
		available media renderers:</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/pms-searching.jpg" />
	</p>

	<p>UMS should automatically detect your device. After about 10
		seconds, you should see this message:</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/pms-eng-status2.jpg" />
	</p>

	<p>UMS has sucessfully detected your PS3 and connected with it. As
		a result, UMS should now appear on the cross media bar (XMB) of your
		PS3:</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/ps3-server.jpg" />
	</p>

	<p>You are now able to browse your computer and play media files.</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/ps3-browsing.jpg" />
	</p>


	<h2>Attention!</h2>

	<p>The PlayStation 3 separates "Photo", "Music" and "Video" in
		different XMB entry points. Even though you see all folders on your
		media server, you can only see the files that correspond to your XMB
		entry point.</p>

	<p>For example: if you choose "Photo" and open your media server
		you will see a folder "Web video", but it will be empty because it
		does not contain any photo files. If you want to view the contents of
		"Web video", you have to navigate to the XMB option "Video" and browse
		your computer from there. You will now find it filled with video
		files.</p>


	<a name="troubleshooting"> </a>
	<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

	<p>UMS should automatically detect your device and display it. In
		some cases UMS does not detect your PS3:</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/pms-eng-status1.jpg" />
	</p>

	<h2>Basic analysis</h2>
	<p>Often it suffices to change to the "General Configuration" tab and verify the
		network settings:</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/pms-eng-general1.jpg" />
	</p>

	<p>
		<img src="images/pms-eng-general.jpg" />
	</p>

	<p>In the majority of reported cases there are two problem causes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Port 5001 is already in use by another software, for example
			Azureus Vuze</li>
		<li>UMS uses the wrong network interface as default</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You can solve the problem by choosing the correct network
		interface and type in an unused port, e.g. 6001. After that save and
		quit, then start UMS again.</p>

	<h2>In depth analysis</h2>

	<p>
		UMS not showing on your DLNA client can be caused by a variety of
		factors, but the potential causes can be broken up into two groups -
		&quot;Before UDP Broadcast&quot; and &quot;After UDP Broadcast&quot;<br />The
		line in the logfile/trace that separates these two groups (this
		signifies the UDP broadcast) is
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		<pre>It's ready! You should see the server appears on XMB</pre>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		<strong>Note 1:</strong> for the suggestions below, Windows, Apple and
		several OEM manufacturers install and enable default protection
		programs (e.g. Windows Defender or Peer Guardian). Make sure that the
		settings for <strong>all</strong> antivirus, firewall, malware and
		protection programs are checked.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Note 2:</strong> direct connections are a special case, so
		check the additional details at the bottom.
	</p>

	<h3>Before UDP Broadcast</h3>
	<p>These can usually be spotted through errors in the logfile /
		trace before the line above.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>UMS cannot bind to the port/IP on the NIC.</dt>
		<dd>
			Some other program is already using that port.
			<ul>
				<li>Check with &quot;netstat -a&quot; through the command line,
					and change the port in the UMS settings if needed.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>A software firewall is blocking javaw.exe (and wrapper.exe if
			running as a Windows service) from binding to the port.</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Open the firewall settings and make sure the .exe's are
					allowed or the specific port is open.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>You forced the wrong IP address in the UMS settings.</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Force the correct IP address (the IP address of the server)
					or clear the setting. Note: you should only have to the force IP if
					you have assigned multiple IPs to a single NIC.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>You opened multiple instances of UMS or a javaw.exe process
			got hung up.</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Close all open instances of UMS and then kill any remaining
					javaw.exe processes. You may have other programs using javaw.exe,
					so exercise caution in killing the tasks.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>UMS is bound to the wrong NIC (e.g. TCP Loopback).</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>You forced the wrong NIC in the UMS settings, so force the
					right NIC or clear the setting. Note: There is no error in the
					logfile/trace</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>The host file on your Linux box needs to be corrected.</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li><a
					href="http://ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3507&amp;p=16041#p16041">http://ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3507&amp;p=16041#p16041</a>.
					Note: There is no error in the logfile/trace</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>You do not have proper access or permissions for the UMS
			install folder.</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>You need to make sure there are full read and write
					permissions on the UMS install folder.
					<ul>
						<li>Check the base file system permissions.</li>
						<li>On Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 reinstall 
							with &quot;Run as Administrator&quot; on the installer.</li>
						<li>Check if any filesystem protection programs are blocking
							access (some antivirus or malware programs have this feature).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>UMS is taking its time to register a component or setting.</dt>
		<dd>
			Large collections of
			files (e.g. a large iTunes database) can take quite some time for UMS to go
			through. You need to either:
			<ul>
				<li>Wait for UMS to do its thing, after which it should
					properly broadcast and show up on your device, or</li>
				<li>Disable the engine or library setting.</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3>After UDP Broadcast</h3>
	<p>At this point everything should be fine within UMS, so you need
		to look externally.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>You have Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 10 and it's using the
			&quot;Public&quot; settings instead of &quot;Private&quot;</dt>
		<dd>
			PUBLIC settings is used in non trusted network and PRIVATE is used in
			home (trusted) network so change your cable (ethernet or LAN) network
			to PRIVATE. In PUBLIC mode most of features as SSDP etc. are
			disabled. <a
				href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Choosing-a-network-location">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Choosing-a-network-location</a>
		</dd>
		<dt>Your software firewall is blocking incoming traffic from your
			DLNA device</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Add the device's IP to your firewall's &quot;Trusted
					List&quot; or allow all local traffic</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>Your router is blocking the traffic</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Check the router's firewall to see if the traffic is being
					blocked</li>
				<li>Check your router's settings to see if there are any
					settings to allow UDP traffic or multicast traffic</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Note 1: Most UPnP settings on routers are to allow the devices
				on the LAN to dynamically configure the port forwarding and other
				router settings with minimal user interaction. This should not need
				to be enabled for the actual UPnP/DLNA traffic in the LAN, and in
				some cases it actually causes issues when enabled on bad routers.</p>

			<p>Note 2: Port forwarding is not required for standard use of
				UMS. It is only needed if you're trying to stream web-content.</p>

			<p>Note 3: Some routers are crap and either a) do not have the
				proper settings or b) just mishandle traffic regardless of the
				settings. This can even vary within the same router for wired vs
				wireless traffic.</p>

			<p>You may use a switch or a hub which is really cheap as a
				workaround. Connect your DLNA device, PC and router to the
				switch/hub and internet connectivity is still there, but you will
				not have trouble with your routers firewall anymore... This will of
				course only work with wired connections.</p>

			<p>There are firmware bugs on some DLAN or powerline adapters
				which prevent certain broadcasts from being transmitted (like using
				a firewall). This will also cause connection problems.</p>

			<p>
				If you have checked everything else, give the <a
					href="http://www.universalmediaserver.com/forum/">forum</a> or Google a
				search and see if other people are having UPnP or DLNA issues with
				the same router. You could also see if a different DLNA program
				(WMP, TVersity, Wild, etc) works using the same router or settings.
			</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>Your server and device are on different subnets</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Per the DLNA protocol (which uses UDP broadcast packets),
					the server and device must be on the same subnet. The easiest way
					to check is if you can ping the device from the server (successful
					ping = on same subnet). This issue should only really happen if you
					have multiple routers or managed switches in your network. If you
					only have a single router/switch, then you incorrectly set a manual
					IP address on at least one of your devices leading to a subnet
					mismatch</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>Your device is not set up to access any DLNA servers</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>See your device's manual. Note: this only covers UMS
					showing up on your device, nothing regarding playback or file
					browsing - <a
					href="http://ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3507&amp;p=16952#p16952">viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3507&amp;p=16952#p16952</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
	</dl>


	<h3>Other issues</h3>
	<p>In addition, you can run into issues (both Before and After UDP
		Broadcast) when trying to use a direct connection (no router or
		switch, just the computer with UMS and the device)</p>

	<p>Examples:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>UMS cannot bind to the IP/Port because both devices need to be
			turned on for the connection to exist (before UMS is started)</li>
		<li>You did not use a crossover cable (only needed if BOTH devices
			are NOT gigabit)</li>
		<li>You have a mismatch in the IP settings</li>
		<li>The device has two (or more) NICs and is using the wrong one
			(eg PS3 still using the wifi NIC)</li>
	</ul>
