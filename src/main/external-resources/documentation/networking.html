	<h1>Networking and technical basics</h1>

	<h2>Network fundamentals</h2>
	<p>
		Before installing and running PS3 you should get an overview of the
		network topology. The Playstation 3 communicates with your computer.
		If one wants to see web content like YouTube videos an internet
		connection is required. Most used technology for accessing the
		internet is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsl">ADSL</a>-
		or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_internet">cable-internet</a>-connection.
		You connect the socket with a modem (ADSL or cable) which will later
		do the dial in. The modem can be connected directly to the computer.
		Most people use a WLAN-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router">router</a>
		to connect. The router is then a gateway to the internet for PS3 and
		your computer.
	</p>

	</p>

	<h3>WLAN</h3>
	<p>
		In most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN">WLAN</a>-routers
		nowadays there is an integrated modem and WLAN-<a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_point">accesspoint</a>.
		The PS3 and notebooks both have integrated WLAN-<a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_card">NIC</a>s and can
		therefore communicate via WLAN when logged in into the access point.
		The integrated WLAN network card of PS3 is compatible to standard
		802.11 b/g. This means a maximum network speed of 54Mb/s. To log in
		into the WALN-access point you need the following information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>WLAN network name (<a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSID">SSID</a>)</li>
		<li>WLAN network password (<a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-shared_key">PSK</a>)</li>

		<li>encryption standard (<a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wpa">WPA</a>, <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wpa2#WPA2">WPA2</a>)</li>
		<li>radio channel / frequency</li>
	</ul>

	<p>All these settings are defined on your WLAN router / access
		point. If there are a lot of WLAN-networks in your range try to change
		to a radio channel with the biggest frequency distance regarding the
		other channels. Otherwise you may experience poor network quality and
		speed. Another quality factor is having walls with much ferroconcrete.</p>

	<p>You can reach an average speed of 35Mb/s. For streaming HD
		videos this might be not enough.</p>


	<h3>LAN</h3>
	<p>
		The biggest advantage of <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network">LAN</a>
		(wired connections) is its maximum bandwidth of 1000 Mb/s. One big
		disadvantage is you have to wire all devices, so you need physical
		access. The devices (router, computer, PS3) have to be wired with <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable">Cat5e</a>
		S/FTP with RJ45-plugs. All devices have to be connected to your router
		integrated switch. Of course you can extend the switch ports of your
		router with an uplink to an external <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch">switch</a>. If
		your router switch ports are 100 Mb/s you can tune up maximum speed
		with an external 1000 Mb/s switch. The link speed and duplex mode
		should be handled automatically via <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonegotiation">autonegotiation</a>.
		Sometimes it does not work correctly and you have to change settings
		on your computer by yourself.
	</p>

	<p>Example screenshot for changing linkspeed and duplex mode in
		Windows XP:</p>
	<p>

	</p>

	<h3>DLAN</h3>
	<p>
		If it is not possible to wire your devices but you need a higher
		network transfer rate there is a solution available called DLAN, also
		known as powerLAN. In this case you use your power line for sending
		data across it. Market leader for this technology is <a
			href="http://www.devolo.com/consumer/dlan-mains-supply-network-fastest-200-mbit.html">devolo</a>.
		You can get DLAN adapters with up to 200 Mb/s.
	</p>
	<p>There are new 1000 Mb/s powerline adapters available from
		Belkin!</p>

	<h3>TCP/IP, DHCP, ICS, DNS and firewall</h3>
	<p>
		The router is default gateway for all devices in your home network.
		The communication is done via <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp/ip">TCP/IP</a> protocol. In
		such a network every device needs an identifier called <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address">IP-address</a>.
		More than one program on your PC can use network at the same time.
		Therefore these programs also use an identifier called <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_number">port number</a>. PS3
		media server uses port 5001 as default. You can change that if it is
		already used by another software. Your home network is a <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network">private
			network</a> and therefore uses special IP-addresses. The IP range is
		limited by the so called <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnet_mask">subnet mask</a>
		(e.g. 255.255.255.0). Because nobody can memorize a large numbers of
		IP addresses (like 74.125.67.100 for google.com) you need another
		network service called <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>
		which translates IP addresses into domain names and vice versa. The
		router forwards DNS requests to a DNS server of your provider and
		sends the answer to the requesting device.
	</p>

	<p>
		Setting up an IP-network is not a simple task. There was also a need
		for automation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhcp">DHCP</a>
		solves this issue. Your router has an integrated DHCP server which
		sets up every network device (PS3 or computer) automatically. Do not
		use DHCP and internet connection sharing (<a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Connection_Sharing">ICS</a>),
		a windows feature, at the same time. ICS has to be deactivated.
	</p>
	<p>It is possible that your computer has more than one network card
		built in. If you use virtualization software (VMware, Virtualbox,
		etc.) additional virtual NICs are created.</p>

	</p>

	<p>
		For security reasons a <a title="Firewall"
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall">firewall</a> is
		integrated in your router. The firewall restrics communication with
		the internet. Most router integrated firewalls do not restrict
		communication in your local network. It is also possible that there is
		a personal firewall software running on your computer. To get UMS
		running you have to open port 1900 (UPnP discovery) and 5001 (UMS). If
		you change the port for UMS in configuration you have to change your
		firewall settings as well.
	</p>

	<h3>UPnP</h3>
	<p>
		Windows only discovers UPnP devices in your home network when <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol">SSDP</a>
		service is running. Here is a Microsoft knowledge base article on <a
			href="http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=kb%3Ben-us%3B941206&amp;x=13&amp;y=8">how
			to enable SSDP</a>.
