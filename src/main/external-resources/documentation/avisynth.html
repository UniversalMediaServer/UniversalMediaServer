		<h1>AviSynth</h1>
		<h2>Why transcode?</h2>
		<p>You may think why bother with transcoding when muxing is
			available. That is absolutely right in most cases. But there are some
			video files which can't be muxed because of special conditions. For
			example, you may get a trailer with h.264 video codec and AVC level
			5.1. but your playback device (PS3, Xbox, TV) might not support that.
			In that case you will need transcoding.</p>
		<p>You can see that there are some reasons why people want to
			optimize transcoding. On the Windows platform there is an additional
			method available for transcoding.</p>
		<h2>AviSynth</h2>
		<p>
			<a title="AviSynth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avisynth">AviSynth</a>
			is a frame server for free, available on Windows platform (development
			of the Linux version will not be continued). Regarding UMS readme one
			should install <a title="AviSynth 2.5.7" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/avisynth2/files/AviSynth%202.5/AviSynth%202.5.7/Avisynth_257.exe/download">AviSynth
			2.5.7</a>. Latest AviSynth 2.5.8 seems to cause stuttering on certain
			files.
		</p>
		<h3>VSfilter</h3>
		<p>
			After installing AviSynth you also have to install the plugin
			vsfilter. <a title="VSfilter AviSynth" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303&amp;package_id=84359">Download
			it here</a>. You have to decompress the 7z-file and copy the vsfilter.dll
			from unicode-subdirectory to your AviSynth plugin directory
			(C:\program files\AviSynth 2.5\plugins).
		</p>
		<h3>Decoding with ffdshow</h3>
		<p>
			Transcoding means decoding the video in the first step on the PC and
			in the second step encoding it to MPG2 and streaming it to your PS3.
			For decoding the free software <a title="ffdshow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ffdshow">ffdshow</a> is commonly
			being used. In order to demux container formats ffdshow needs the free
			<a title="Haali Media Splitter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haali_Media_Splitter">Haali
			Media Splitter</a>. Both software are available as software packages, so
			called codec packs.
		</p>
		<h3>K-Lite Mega Codec Pack</h3>
		<p>
			Who wants to get an "everything included" package should consider
			K-Lite Mega Codec Pack which is available <a title="K-Lite Mega Codec Pack" href="http://www.codecguide.com/download_mega.htm">here</a>. There
			are different variants available, from basic to mega but also a 64-bit
			variant.
		</p>
		<p>After installing k-lite codec pack you may have to configure
			subtitles and your speaker setup.</p>
		<p>Change to Windows Start menu "programs &gt; K-Lite Codec Pack
			&gt; Configuration &gt; ffdshow audio decoder". In menu "mixer" you
			have to set your speaker config. In order to get 5.1 surround sound
			(speakers: 4x surround, 1x center, 1x subwoofer) on your PS3 you have
			to set "3/0/2 - 5 channels".</p>
		<p>After that, run "programs &gt; K-Lite Codec Pack &gt;
			Configuration &gt;Haali Media Splitter" and change to options tab.
			Choose menu "languages" and select your language priority:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Audio language priority: ger,eng</li>
			<li>Subtitle language priority: ger,eng</li>
			<li>Audio and subtitle languages: ger,off;eng,ger;*,ger;*,eng</li>
			<li>Trackset languages: ger,eng</li>
			<li>The example above is optimized for German language. Here is an example for English language:</li>
			<li>Audio language priority: eng</li>
			<li>Subtitle language priority: eng</li>
			<li>Audio and subtitle languages: eng,off;*,eng</li>
			<li>Trackset languages: eng</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The settings above are only valid when the avisynth video engine
			is used for transcoding.</p>
		<p>Go to menu compatibility and set "autoload VSFilter" to "Yes".</p>
		<h3>CCCP Codec Pack</h3>
		<p>
			For those who prefer minimal installations <a title="CCCP Codec Pack" href="http://www.cccp-project.net/">CCCP codec pack</a> is the right
			choice. It is available <a title="Download CCCP Codec Pack" href="http://www.cccp-project.net/download.php?type=cccp">here</a>.
			Read <a title="CCCP Codec Pack FAQ" href="http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ">FAQ</a>
			for configuration. It should be similar to setup K-Lite Codec Pack.
		</p>
		<h2>Activate AviSynth engine</h2>
		<p>
			<img title="pms-engines2" src="images/pms-engines2.jpg" alt="pms-engines2" />
		</p>
		<p>After installing and configuring AviSynth, ffdshow and Haali
			media splitter you can enable both engines AviSynth/MEncoder and
			AviSynth/ffmpeg.</p>
