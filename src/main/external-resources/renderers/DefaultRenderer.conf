# Profile for Default Renderer.
#
# This is an example configuration file which should be used as a reference
# for creating your own renderer config. It contains descriptions of all of
# the available options.
#
# Configuration profiles serve two purposes:
#
#   - Allow UMS to recognize a specific connecting renderer
#   - Define the possibilities of that renderer
#
# When a new renderer config is added to the program, a line for it should be
# added to the uninstall section of src/main/external-resources/nsis/setup.nsi
#

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RENDERER INFORMATION
#

# Determines the name that is displayed in the UMS user interface when this
# renderer connects. The convention is [Vendor name] [space] [Model].
# Default: Unknown renderer
RendererName = 

# Determines the icon that is displayed in the UMS user interface when this
# renderer connects. By default, these icons are bundled with UMS in ums.jar,
# but they can easily be customised:
# http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=3507&p=49536#p49536
# Default: unknown.png
RendererIcon = 

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RENDERER RECOGNITION
#
# When a renderer connects, it sends a "User-Agent" header. UMS tries to
# match that header with all configuration profiles. If none of the profiles
# match, the message "Unknown User-Agent:" will be displayed in the logs and
# UMS will switch to a default profile.
#
# Because matching involves all renderer configuration profiles, it is
# important to match as long a string as possible. This increases the chances
# that a match is unique. Version numbers are best avoided.
#
# To learn the exact headers of any renderer, set the logging level in
# "logback.xml" to "TRACE" and look for messages like "Received on socket:".
#

# Optional regular expression to detect a connected renderer.
# The expression is case insensitive. When the expression is empty User-Agent
# headers are not used, this is the default. Note that one renderer can use
# several different User-Agent headers.
#
# Note that UMS will attempt to match UserAgentSearch to the header block
# as a whole, so if the same identifier sometimes appears in other headers
# UserAgentSearch will return a positive match in those cases as well. For
# example the PS3 uses the phrase 'PLAYSTATION 3' sometimes in User-Agent
# and sometimes in X-AV-Client-Info (or both) and just defining
# 'UserAgentSearch = PLAYSTATION 3' will cover all these cases.
#
# Examples:
#
# UserAgentSearch = Platinum/.*DLNADOC/|yxplayer2|MPlayer |NSPlayer/
# UserAgentSearch = Windows-Media-Player-DMS|Microsoft-Windows
#
# Ignoring the "UPnP/1.0" and "UPnP/1.0 DLNADOC/1.50" headers since they are
# too general, plus they can be detected from the additional header.
# Default: ""
UserAgentSearch = 

# Regular expression to recognize the dlna details of a upnp-advertising renderer.
#
# When a upnp-advertising renderer connects, it provides a set of "dlna details"
# which UMS will reorganize in a consistent format on the renderer's gui panel

# A good starting point is to use unique parts of '<manufacturer> , <modelName>'

# SUPPORTED MEDIA FORMATS
#
# This section defines which media formats are supported by this renderer. If
# a file is supported and its mediainfo indicates that it falls within the
# capabilities of this renderer, UMS will stream the file to the renderer. All
# other files will be transcoded to the format specified in "TranscodeVideo"
# or "TranscodeAudio" before being sent to the renderer.
#
# Each format that the renderer supports should result in a "Supported" line
# that defines the capabilities of the renderer. When MediaInfo = true, media
# files are parsed and their properties are matched against all "Supported"
# lines. If a value for a specific property cannot be parsed, that property
# is assumed to match.
#
# The order of the "Supported" lines matters: when multiple lines match, the
# first match is used.
#
# The media parser and this configuration file will recognize the following
# formats and codecs. Use lower case names only. Regular expressions are
# supported.
