#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Profile for PlayStation 3.
# DO NOT MODIFY THIS (OR AT YOUR OWN RISK)
#
# This configuration profile serves two purposes:
#
#   - Allow UMS to recognize a specific connecting renderer
#   - Define the possibilities of that renderer
#

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RENDERER INFORMATION
#

# RendererName: Determines the name that is displayed in the UMS user
# interface when this renderer connects.
RendererName = PlayStation 3

# RendererIcon: Determines the icon that is displayed in the UMS user
# interface when this renderer connects. By default, these icons are
# bundled with UMS in ums.jar, but they can easily be customised:
# http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=3507&p=49536#p49536
RendererIcon = ps3.png

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RENDERER RECOGNITION
#
# When a renderer connects, it sends a "User-Agent" header. UMS tries to
# match that header with all configuration profiles. If none of the profiles
# match, the message "Unknown User-Agent:" will be displayed in the logs and
# UMS will switch to a default profile.
#
# Because matching involves all renderer configuration profiles, it is
# important to match as long a string as possible. This increases the chances
# that a match is unique. Version numbers are best avoided.
#
# To learn the exact headers of any renderer, set the logging level in
# "logback.xml" to "TRACE" and look for messages like "Received on socket:".
#
# ============================================================================
# PlayStation 3 uses the following strings:
#
# User-Agent: PLAYSTATION 3
# ---
# User-Agent: UPnP/1.0
# X-AV-Client-Info: av=5.0; cn="Sony Computer Entertainment Inc."; mn="PLAYSTATION 3"; mv="1.0";
# ---
# User-Agent: UPnP/1.0 DLNADOC/1.50
# X-AV-Client-Info: av=5.0; cn="Sony Computer Entertainment Inc."; mn="PLAYSTATION 3"; mv="1.0";
# ============================================================================
#

# UserAgentSearch: Optional regular expression to detect a connected renderer.
# The expression is case insensitive. When the expression is empty User-Agent
# headers are not used, this is the default. Note that one renderer can use
# several different User-Agent headers.
#
# Examples:
#
# UserAgentSearch = Platinum/.*DLNADOC/|yxplayer2|MPlayer |NSPlayer/
# UserAgentSearch = Windows-Media-Player-DMS|Microsoft-Windows
#
# Ignoring the "UPnP/1.0" and "UPnP/1.0 DLNADOC/1.50" headers since they are
# too general, plus they can be detected from the additional header.
UserAgentSearch = PLAYSTATION

# UserAgentAdditionalHeader: Optional additional HTTP header for better
# detection. When defined, UMS also considers this header when trying to find
# a match. Even when the standard UserAgentSearch match fails, this extra
# header can provide a positive match.
UserAgentAdditionalHeader = X-AV-Client-Info

# UserAgentAdditionalHeaderSearch: Regular expression to search for in the
# additional HTTP header.
UserAgentAdditionalHeaderSearch = PLAYSTATION

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BASIC CAPABILITIES
#
# This indicates to UMS what kind of media the renderer can handle. Files that
# the renderer cannot handle will be hidden from it.
#

# Video: Set to "true" if the renderer can play video.
Video = true

# Audio: Set to "true" if the renderer can play audio.
Audio = true

# Image: Set to "true" if the renderer can display images.
Image = true

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DLNA SETTINGS
#

# SeekByTime: Set to true to use the DLNA feature seek-by-time instead of
# the default seek-by-byte method.
#
# Valid values:
#
#     true:
#
#         The renderer supports seek-by-time.
#
#     false:
#
#         The renderer doesn't support seek-by-time, so it should
#         only use the default seek-by-byte method.
#
#     exclusive:
#
#         While most renderers that support seek-by-time also support
#         seek-by-byte, some (e.g. the PS3 [1] and Panasonic TVs [2])
#         behave unreliably if both are permitted when transcoding files.
#         This option works around this by disabling seek-by-byte for
#         transcoded files when permitting seek-by-time.
#
# The default is false.
#
# [1] Seeking via "Go To" with the PS3 (firmware 4.31) and MEncoder works with "exclusive", but hangs or crashes with "true".
# [2] http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=15841
SeekByTime = exclusive

# DLNALocalizationRequired: Serve different flavors of localization in the
# DLNA parameters (PAL/NTSC, NA/EU/JP) to allow every world wide renderer to
# see the files. Important for Sony Bravia TVs.
DLNALocalizationRequired = false

# CBRVideoBitrate is useful for renderers without SeekByTime support. It does time2byte conversion to support FF/RW.
# Only possibility how to predict where we are when seeking is using CBR bitrate instead of VBR used by default
# Creating a CBR stream with MEncoder is 3 times slower than using VBR so bear this in mind if you have a slow computer!
# Speed can hopefully be optimized a little bit in the future:

# ByteToTimeseekRewindSeconds is used for fine-tuning, so the default is 0
# ByteToTimeseekRewindSeconds=0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MEDIAINFO
#

# MediaInfo: Set to "true" if UMS should parse files with MediaInfo. This will

# playback errors. It also enables the use of "Supported" to more accurately
# define the supported formats for the renderer.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TRANSCODING AND MUXING CAPABILITIES
#
# It is very likely that a renderer cannot render all file formats. If this is
# the case, UMS should transcode or mux the file to a format that the renderer
# can display. This section defines the format that UMS should transcode or
# mux to.

# MaxVideoBitrateMbps: The maximum bitrate supported by the media renderer.
# Setting to "0" means unlimited.
# If computer is low on resources it is better to avoid using bandwidth limit which is much CPU demanding
# It is better to lower quality settings by defining "CustomMencoderQualitySettings".
# By lowering quality also bitrate is decreased but it is not so CPU aggresive so it is preferred to use it this way

# to be returned. Possible values are:
#            0: No size is sent to the renderer (default value)
# 100000000000: Fake size of 100 GB is sent to the renderer.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SUPPORTED MEDIA FORMATS
#
# This section defines which media formats are supported by this renderer. If
# a file is supported and its mediainfo indicates that it falls within the
# capabilities of this renderer, UMS will stream the file to the renderer. All
# other files will be transcoded before being sent to the renderer.
#
# Each format that the renderer supports should result in a "Supported" line
# that defines the capabilities of the renderer. When MediaInfo = true, media
# files are parsed and their properties are matched against all "Supported"
# lines. If a value for a specific property cannot be parsed, that property
# is assumed to match.
#
# The order of the "Supported" lines matters: when multiple lines match, the
# first match is used.
#
# The media parser and this configuration file will recognize the following
# formats and codecs. Use lower case names only. Regular expressions are
# supported.

#
#    n:    The maximum number of audio channels used in the file as parsed by

#
#    s:    The maximum audio sample frequency used in the file as parsed by
#          the MediaInfo library, specified in Hertz.
#
#    b:    The maximum audio bit rate used in the file as parsed by the
#          MediaInfo library, specified in bits per second.
#
#    w:    The maximum video width used in the file as parsed by the MediaInfo
#          library, specified in pixels.
#
#    h:    The maximum video height used in the file as parsed by the MediaInfo
#          library, specified in pixels.
#
#    qpel: Quarter pixel codec setting in the file as parsed by the MediaInfo
#          library.
#
#    gmc:  The number of global motion compensation warp points in the file as
#          parsed by the MediaInfo library.
