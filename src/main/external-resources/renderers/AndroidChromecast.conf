#
# Known Issues:
# - Seeking support is limited.
# Prerequisites
# - FFMPEG needs to be Primary Transcoder. 
# - Android renderer needs to be disabled.

# Supported Media Type: https://developers.google.com/cast/supported_media_types
#	All Google Cast devices at a minimum support the following media types:
#		Video codecs: H.264 High Profile Level 4.1, 4.2 and 5, VP8
#		Audio decoding: HE-AAC, LC-AAC, CELT/Opus, MP3, Vorbis
#		Containers: MP4/CENC, WebM, MPEG-DASH, SmoothStreaming
#		Level 1 DRM support: Widevine, PlayReady
#
# This is the important part (thanks Einzeln):
#   (Make video work) 
#      -c:v through -level ensure the video stream is encoded properly for chromecast.
#   (Make audio work) 
#      -c:a = codec in this case we use libmp3lame for MP3 | libvo-aacenc for LC-AAC and -ac is limiting audio channels for casting.
#   (Prevent stutter due to slow encoding) 
#      -preset ultrafast helps your processor encode the video as quickly as possible. 
#      If your processor is fast enough try increasing this. I expect you might get better quality out of your limited bitrate.
#   (Prevent stutter due to slow connection) 
#      -b:v and -buffsize should ensure the encoded video does not exceed a bitrate that can fit through a wifi connection. 
#      These sometimes seem to be ignored in the same way MaxVideoBitrateMBPS does.
#   (output) 
#      -f matroska, I know chromecast doesn't support mkv. But webm is basically a dumbed down mkv so this works. 
#      Using mp4 has given me problems for some reason.
