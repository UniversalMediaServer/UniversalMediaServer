# ps3mediaserver profile for iPad, iPhone and iPod
#
# This profile is still in a highly experimental stage. Playback quality
# (if at all) depends very much on the app that is used and is sketchy at best
# at this time.
# You are encouraged to experiment and report back the results on the forums

# All supported media formats of this renderer (the rest will be transcoded)
# First steps towards a faster/proper file/codec/mimetype management system (false by default)
# 1- Parse files with mediainfo on Windows/OSX (Linux too if libmediainfo and libzen installed)
# 2- Deprecate following parameters: MuxH264ToMpegTS,MuxDTSToMpeg,MuxLPCMToMpeg,MimeTypesChanges
# 3- The server will skip badly parsed, corrupted files or wrong coding, preventing potential playback errors
# 4- Faster browsing, due to the launch of ffmpeg/mplayer first thumbnailer process with each http client request, rather than in the browse DLNA request
MediaInfo=false
