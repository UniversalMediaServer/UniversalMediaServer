This directory contains versioned update files. An update should only be made available if it doesn't break too many things. Given a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version (e.g. 1.30.1):

    changes in MAJOR always require a new update file
    changes in MINOR may require a new update file if they break plugins or alter profile paths
    changes in PATCH never require a new update file

Note: in all cases, the old update file should be kept so that old releases can update to the latest version of UMS that doesn't cause upgrade issues.

Update files are named update_<version>.properties e.g. update_2.properties. The <version> ID is arbitrary. As long as it's distinct for each compatible set of PMS releases, it can be anything. Currently it's an integer which is incremented for each "generation".

If a new update file is created, UPDATE_SERVER_URL in src/main/java/net/pms/configuration/Build.java should be updated to point to it.
