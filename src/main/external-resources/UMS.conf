# ============================================================================
# Configuration file for UMS
# ============================================================================
# Introduction:
#
# This "UMS.conf" file holds the configuration settings for UMS. These settings
# are usually set using the UMS graphical user interface. If you are running
# UMS on a headless system, you may not be able to kick off the GUI; instead,
# you can edit the UMS.conf file to control the operation of UMS. A restart of
# UMS is required after editing this file. 
#
# Commenting out an option or leaving it empty forces the UMS default
# that is indicated.
#
# Key value pairs
# ---------------
# The configuration file contains key/value pairs separated by an equals (=)
# sign; the key on the left and the value on the right. The value is edited in
# this file or set using the UMS GUI and saved. The value can take a number of
# different forms:
#
#  - toggle: a checkbox or boolean; either "true" or "false"
#  - selector: a dropdown menu in the GUI, generating a string or numeric
#              value. Available options will usually be stated below
#  - string: a short text or a number
#  - text: a longer text with embedded line breaks
#  - list: a comma-separated list of strings or numbers
#
# In the file below the value type is shown after the GUI option label.
