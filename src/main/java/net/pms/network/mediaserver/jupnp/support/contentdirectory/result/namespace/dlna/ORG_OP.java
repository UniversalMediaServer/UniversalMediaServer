/**
 * MM op-param (Operations Parameter â€“ Common guidelines).
 *
 * The op-value is a string composed of two characters: a-val and b-val. The
 * meaning of these values is depending on whether the context is for the HTTP
 * Media Transport or RTP Media Transport.
 *
 * The DLNA.ORG_OP parameter indicates support for transport layer headers
 * responsible that facilitate random access operations on content binaries,
 * under the "Full Random Access Data Availability" model.
 *
 * If the op-param is present and if either a-val or b-val is "1", then the
 * "Full Random Access Data Availability" model shall be the data access model
 * that applies in the context of the protocolInfo value.
 *
 * Specifically, this means that the transport operation (that is indicated by
 * the a-val or b-val) shall be supported for the entire content binary.
 *
 * If the flags-param token is included in the 4th field, then the
 * s0-increasing, lop-npt, and lop-bytes bits of the primary-flags token shall
 * be set to false.
 *
 * If the associated HTTP Server Endpoint always returns 406 (Not Acceptable) in
 * response to requests that use either HTTP header for the context of the
 * protocolInfo, then the 4th field shall omit the op-param.
 *
 * If the Content Source assigns "0" to both a-val and b-val of the op-param,
 * then the op-param shall be omitted from the 4th field.
