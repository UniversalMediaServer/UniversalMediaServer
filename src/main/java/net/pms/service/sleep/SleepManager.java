/**
 * This class manages system sleep prevention. It must not be instantiated until
 * {@link PMS#getConfiguration()} and {@link PMS#getRegistry()} have been
 * initialized.
 * <p>
 * This class spawns a worker thread that will do the actual calls to the OS on
 * demand. Once spawned, this thread will be kept alive until {@link #stop()} is
 * called or the worker thread is interrupted. All OS calls are made from the
 * same worker thread. p> Usage is simple: Call {@link #startPlaying()} to
 * indicate to {@link SleepManager} that a playback has started, and call
 * {@link #stopPlaying()} when the playback stops. Any number of "play events"
 * can occur simultaneously, {@link SleepManager} will only allow sleep (if
 * configured to {@link PreventSleepMode#PLAYBACK} when all
 * {@link #startPlaying()} calls has been canceled with corresponding
 * {@link #stopPlaying()} calls. For situations where there are no "play events"
 * (like for images) but you still want to "extend" the time the computer stays
 * awake, call {@link #postponeSleep()}. This will simply reset the system's
 * idle sleep timer so that the timer starts from the beginning. This class is
 * thread-safe so the methods can be called form any thread.
 * <p>
 * This class uses the configured settings for sleep management, and will handle
 * the platform "automatically". Currently only Windows and macOS are supported.
 * On other operating systems no worker thread will be spawned and this class
 * will essentially do nothing.
 * <p>
 * {@link SleepManager} is designed to run as a singleton instance, two
 * instances should not be used at the same time.
