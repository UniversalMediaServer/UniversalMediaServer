This folder contains circular flag icons which (inaccurately) represent languages. They are 254x254 PNGs with transparent backgrounds.

They appear to be taken from here:

- and are released under a Creative Commons license:

Icon dimensions must be <= 255x255 and file sizes must be <= 65536 bytes.

These icons are supported by the PS3 and Sony BRAVIA TVs and probably other renderers. They are used to represent different subtitle language options in the #--TRANSCODE--# folder.

NOTE: these should NOT be flags as many are inaccurate and several are offensive:

Patches (e.g. a set of icons with ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 language codes) welcome!
