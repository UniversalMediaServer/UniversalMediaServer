This directory contains images of renderers which are shown on the Status tab
when UMS identifies that renderer.

These images typically follow the same convention:
   - A photo of the renderer.
   - The renderer is facing slightly to your left.
   - The image format is PNG with a transparent background.
   - The height is 128 pixels.
   - The width does not exceed 300 pixels.
   - The photo is vertically centered when applicable.
   - There is a 10 pixel margin on the left and right sides of the photo.
