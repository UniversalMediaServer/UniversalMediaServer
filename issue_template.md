# How to contribute

In order to help diagnose and fix your issue we often need your "debug information". It's easy to save this information and attach it to a GitHub issue:

  * Start UMS.
  * Go to the `Logs` tab.
  * Press the `Create TRACE logs` button which restarts UMS in the "TRACE" mode. If that doesn't work for some reason, either select `Trace` from the `Log Level` dropdown at the bottom or set `log_level = TRACE` in the configuration file and restart UMS manually.
  * Reproduce the problem.
  * Click `Pack debug files` on the lower left.
  * Click `Zip selected files`.
  * Save the zip file to a location you will remember.
  * Attach the zip file to the GitHub issue.
