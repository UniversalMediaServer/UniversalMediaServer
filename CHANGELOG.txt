    * Fixed double-loading of plugins
    * Renamed PMSEncoder file for easier updating.
      Note: You should manually delete the PMSEncoder file/s in your installation directory (pmsencoder-1.4.0.jar and/or pmsencoder-1.3.0.jar)
    * Added a lot of new things to WEB.conf by merging Dan_Aykroyd's file from http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=9304
      Note: WEB.conf will not be overwritten, so if you want the new one you need to either rename or delete the old one.
